rsp-internal
============

My projects on GitHub with names starting with "rsp-" prefix
(not to be confused with rsp suffix or infix)
are either some experiments, early stage work in progress or
my internal projects that are in public repositories mostly
for backup purposes but are unlikely to be useful for enyone else.

For more useful projects see:

* https://github.com/rsp?tab=repositories

and look for projects without the "rsp-" prefix in their name.

My Node modules:

* https://www.npmjs.com/~rsp
